There was a time when all companies used data centers that they owned or co-owned. Such as:
- A massive dedicated data centers
- or simple server closet (un "armadio")

That was trasleted in costs. Such as infrastructure costs or personenel and hardware costs.
- So in genera is not a cheap model for a business.

The next evolution was data center virtualization (virtual server starting from physical servers), a more efficent model in terms of usage of existing hardware. That was ppossible trough softwares called:
- hypervisors (to divide a physical server in multiple virtual servers).
The problem remained that all of the physiscal harware was still being kept in the company's data centers.


# What is the cloud computing ?
Cloud computing is a way to access data, applications, hosts, resources and services through Internet without having them physically.

To use it we need to refer to a company called cloud provider that loans these services (Google, Amazon aws, Microsoft).

Using the cloud computing the organization of a business can:
- move faster 
- reduce downtime
- save money 
- be more secure.

## Resource pooling
The most fundumental characteristic of the cloud is **==the resource pooling==*.
- The provider abstracts the physical layer away from the customer and collects resources into a pool.

Portion of this pool are then allocated to different customers and adjusted based on their needs.

## Self service
The customers can add or remove infrastructures or make changes instantly, sometimes just using a button.

This can bring the customers to misconfigure the security of their platform, and this is one of the most common reasons of cloud data breaches.


## Broad Network Access
The cloud is accessible from anywhere, in general via the Internet.


## Rapid elasticity
The cloud gives customers the ability to scale their infrastructure when they want in order to make it fit the needs of the applications.
- No more problems if the application is overestimated or underestimated in terms of size.
- Storage and computing power can be added dynamically if the load increases and then removed when it subsides.

It is also possible to create alerts in order to dynamically scal up and down the infrastructure when a threshold is reached.


## Measured Pay Per Use
The cloud can allow to have a pay per use model in order to have costs in proportion with the usage of the services.
