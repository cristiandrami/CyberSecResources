# Cloud Service Models
The cloud is delivered into three main ways
1. Software as Service
2. Platform as Service
3. Infrastructure as Service

## Software as a Service (SaaS)
This is the most used type of cloud service.
The idea is that you access a solution over the internet that is fully managed and provided by the cloud provider.
- You can use a service through internet without install it (gmail, Google docs, dropvox for data storage and so on)

Users can access it through a web browser of a mobile app.

The SaaS provider takes care of all technical aspects including patching, infrastructure and storage.

For a business has a lot of advantages:
- The workload of IT teams is reduced (no need for installation, patching)
The disadvantage is that there is only a small or not at all control over the SaaS.


## Platform as a Service
Platform as a service provides a platform for making a new application.
- The vendor gives to the customer all it needs to develop and to make it work an application without dealing with the technical infrastructure.

This platform is delivered online, allowing the developers to focus on creating software without dealing with things like operating systems, updates, storage or infrastructures.

So the provider takes care about the server, the storage and the network for the application of the customer.

Its very good but sometimes business adapts their applications to the cloud provider platfrom and infrastructure and then is so hard to pass to anothore provider.

Platform as a Service is not a plug and play solution and old applications sometimes cannot be adapted to it.



## Infrastructure as a Service
It is a fully managed service for handling things like servers, storage and networking.
- The customer can access to it without buying hardware.

On a big scale it uses virtualization.

users can easily ask for set up the infrastructure through a console or a command line.

It is the more flexible cloud model, giving users a simple access to deploy storage, networking, servers, processing power and more.

The provider takes care about the storage and the hardware, but the customer needs to take care about applications, runtime patching and middleware.



# Cloud Deployment Models
A customer can set up and made available a cloud using five types of Cloud Deployment Models:
1. Public Clouds
2. Private Clouds
3. Community Clouds
4. Hybrid Cloud
5. Multi Cloud

## Public cloud
**==A public cloud is a cloud setup that is open for everyone to use.==** (Google Drive)

The cloud provider takes care of the infrastructure, making sure everyone gets what they need.


## Private cloud
**==A private cloud is a cloud that allows a own exclusive space in the cloud for each organization.==**

Outsiders cannot access it, only the organization employees can access it.

Businesses with sensitive data (military, health care and so on) generally use it.


## Community cloud
In this type of cloud deployment different organizations share a cloud setup. (Regional Hospitals in Italy)

It is used by organizations that have similar needs and rules.
- Used by companies taht cannot pay for private clouds but cannot use public clouds of the industry rules.

It is a special kind of private clouds in which various companies are put in the same group share.


## Hybrid cloud
It mixes a public and a private cloud setup.

## Multi cloud
A multi cloud setups use different cloud platforms in a combination. 
- Basically you use multiple cloud service providers.

Compaines use them for various reasons like following rules, not depending on one provider only, saving money etc.
- 92% of big companies have a multi-cloud plan

Multi cloud setups bring extra complications and security risks.
