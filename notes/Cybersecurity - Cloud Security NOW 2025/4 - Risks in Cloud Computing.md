# Lack of Cloud security skills
Without studying and investing in certification security teams will not be able to meed the challenges that cloud security brings.

These is already a lack of cloud security expertise in the market and an even bigger gap for cloud security.

# Misconfigurations
Misconfigurations in the cloud are the primary reason for most data breaches.

The cloud makes very easy to make changes and push them in production. And it is very easy to misconfigure it and expose sensible data to the Internet.

# Increased attack surface
A public cloud by nature is accessible from outside an organization's perimeter and becomes attractive for attackers.

Security in the cloud requires a mindset change and a focus on identity as the firewall.

# Lack of focus on securing cloud identity
As a cloud environment increases, user management becomes increasingly complex as each cloud usually has its own identity store (with different authorization policies and access privileges).

AWS Identity and Access management or Azure Active Directory are different from each other.

# Lack of Standardization and Visibility
CISOs or Chief information Security Officers often have two main concerns in the cloud:
- How do I enforce security controls consistency in all cloud environments?
- How do i know what is happening and where in the cloud?

Cloud customers often cannot effectively identify and quantify their cloud assets.


# Data leakage
It happens when someone can access sensitive data or not without any privilege and publicly.

Around 51% of teams cite accidental over sharing as a major problem for companies.

A solution is the implementation of a Cloud Access Security  Broker or CASB.


# Data Privacy and compliance
Standards like PCI, DSS, HIPAA, GDPR require controls to be put in place or limit access to sensitive data such as card numbers, medical data, PII etc, and this requires a good understanging of the cloud security controls.

Compliance is shares between the customer and rhe cloud service provider.
- Most providers are already compliant  with standards


# Data Sovereignty, Residence and Control
Data residency refers to where data can be stored and is usually governed by a country's data laws.
You must always know where data are stored.

# Incident Response in the cloud
