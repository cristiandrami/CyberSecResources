The preface is usually one or two pages long and is followed by the organization pages. 
When listing the Program Committee members, whose names should be ordered alphabetically by surname (as should those of the reviewers), kindly just include their universities and countries and not their departments or labs.

We prefer the use of American English in the preface and we ask you to write the preface in the past tense, because it is mainly read after the event.

A third level heading in 9-point font size at the end of the paper is used for general acknowledgments, for example: This study was funded by X (grant number X).
