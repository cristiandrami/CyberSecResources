Apple uses some protection mechanism to avoid the installing of arbitrary apps:
- we can bypass it using the jailbreak


Using xCode we are able to use a development environment for iOS.

# iOS security architecture

The architecture of iOS is split in:
- hardware laywer
- software layer

Each app runs in a sandbox environment and each app is signed by apple.

To put an app in the App store we need a developer profile with a memebership.
- with free profile we could use the sideloading, this means that we can install our iOS apps on the device but just for a limited amount of time (48 H)



iOS uses two file system partition
- user partition, we could navigate it
- OS partition


iPhones have many hardware security features:
- each iOS device has two keys that are put on the device during manufacturing



# Static analysis of iOS apps

Most apps are based on Objective-C. Swift is the newest language used for iOS apps.


Each app is a `.ipa` file that is similar to apk.
- An `.ipa` is a signed bundle of folders and assets.
- it contains a `/Payload` folder and some important files for our analysis
	- `/Payload/Application.app` that is the app itself
	- `/Payload/iTunesMetadata.plist`, that contains info about the app developer
	- `/Payload/Application.app/Info.plist`, important app info like the permissions
	- various `.json` files, Assets and resources


To extract the payload we just need to rename the `.ipa` into `.zip` and extract it.




>NOTE: we can perform iOS app analysis only using a MacOS or a MacOS VM

>To install a VM we can use this guide [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnlhpfOuXos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnlhpfOuXos)
>I cannot legitimate the source of the `.iso` file, so I'm not responsible of anything
