The first thing to do is to install xCode.


To install it we can go on the App store in the Mac and search for `xCode`.

If the app store doesn't allow us to install it we could go there [https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=xcode](https://developer.apple.com/download/all/?q=xcode)
- here we can find the older versions

Once dowloaded we can just move it in the `Applications` forder of our Mac.


# Using Xcode
We could use it to create new projects and etc 


to simulate an iOS device we can go on the top bar ->  `File` ->  `Open Device` -> and select the device we want.

To restart a device in case of errors we can go on top bar -> `Device` -> `Erase all content and settings...`

To have log info about apps we can go on to bar -> `Debug` -> `Open System logs`



# Device License Setup (important)

We need the Device License to sign the application we want to install in our device and also to modify apps to inject for example objection.

Form Xcode we go to  top bar -> `Xcode` -> `Preferences` -> `Accounts` -> `+` and add an apple ID account.


At this point we have to add a team.
- we click on the team section -> `+` -> `Apple development` 
- now we have a certificate 


# .ipa 

## AnyTrans, tool to pull .ipa applications

The first tool we can use is AnyTrans.


We can download this tool from this page [https://www.imobie.com/it/anytrans/](https://www.imobie.com/it/anytrans/)

This is a very easy tool to use.

We connect our device to the Mac and we will see this interface on AnyTrans:
- ![[Pasted image 20240704114009.png]]



At this point we can go on our iPhone and download an app from the App store.

We perform the login on AnyTrans and then we can go on this section:
- ![[Pasted image 20240704114240.png]]
	- see on the left

Here we can click on the `To mac` icon and store this app on the mac locally.
- this will give us the `.ipa` file

## IPATool
This is another tool we can use to pull apps from the App store.

To install it we nee to use `brew`.

To install brew we can use follow the guide here [https://brew.sh/](https://brew.sh/)


At this point we can follow the isntruction on the GitHub repository of IPATool [https://github.com/majd/ipatool](https://github.com/majd/ipatool)
```shell
brew tap majd/repo
brew install ipatool
```

Now we need to authenticate on it:
```shell
ipatool auth login -e email_of_apple_ID
```
- and enter password


At this point we can dowload the `.ipa` files just using:
```shell
ipatool search --limit 2 app
```
- --limit 2 is used to limit to 2 results

To download we just need to use:
```shell
ipatool download --bundle-identifier bundle_id_found_before
```




# Additional emulator options
Except to xCode it exists also `Corellium` that allows us to emulate iOS devices.

It gives us all the info about the requests done by the emulator and so on in a single web tab.
