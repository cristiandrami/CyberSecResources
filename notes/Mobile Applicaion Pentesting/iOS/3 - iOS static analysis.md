First of all we need to rename the `.ipa` file into a `.zip` file.

Then we can extract it:

We click on `Show Package Content` and we can see everything in the `.app` folder:

The `Info.plist` file is one of the most important since contains all the information about the application (like the `Manifest.xml` file in Android).
- Here we could find interesting hardcode data




The **Frameworks** folder contains all the libraries compiled but not included in the application binary file. So it contains all the compiled external libraries used to develop the app.
