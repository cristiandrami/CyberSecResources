First of all we need to rename the `.ipa` file into a `.zip` file.

Then we can extract it:
- ![[Pasted image 20240704143218.png]]



We click on `Show Package Content` and we can see everything in the `.app` folder:
- ![[Pasted image 20240704143337.png]]

The `Info.plist` file is one of the most important since contains all the information about the application (like the `Manifest.xml` file in Android).
- Here we could find interesting hardcode data




The **Frameworks** folder contains all the libraries compiled but not included in the application binary file. So it contains all the compiled external libraries used to develop the app.





## Automated static analysis with MobSF
We can download it from `git@github.com:MobSF/Mobile-Security-Framework-MobSF.git`

```shell 
docker pull opensecurity/mobile-security-framework-mobsf:latest

docker run -it --rm -p 8000:8000 opensecurity/mobile-security-framework-mobsf:latest
```
- then connect to localhost:8000 and upload the apk



WORKING PRACTICE:
```shell
sudo ./setup.sh

sudo ./run.sh
```



At this point we can connect to `localhost:8000`, upload the `.ipa` file and see the result of automatic static analysis.
