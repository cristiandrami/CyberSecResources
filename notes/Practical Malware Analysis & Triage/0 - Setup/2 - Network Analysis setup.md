We need to setup the network adapters in order to protect our real network and our real host from malwares detonation!

So we have to setup a special network adapter in order to make it connect with REMnux and only with it.




**==IMPORTANT==**
To make it work you have to create a folder in `/etc/`:
```bash
sudo mkdir /etc/vbox
```

Then you need to create a file using:
```bash
sudo nano /etc/vbox/networks.conf
```

And put in it:
```text
* 0.0.0.0/0 ::/0
```

>NOTE: otherwise it won't work






So we go on `Tools` -> `Network` -> `Create` -> `Server DHCP Enabled`

At this point we change the IP address putting an address different from our real network one, such as `10.0.0.1`:
- ![[Pasted image 20250204092652.png]]

Now on the `Server DHCP` section we put the server address to `10.0.0.2` , the `lower address bound` will be `10.0.0.3` and the `upper address bound` will be `10.0.0.254`

Now we go on FlareVM machine settings and we put `Host-Only Adapter`:
- ![[Pasted image 20250204105126.png]]
- disable all other adapters

We do the same thing with `REMnux`:
- ![[Pasted image 20250204105226.png]]

In both `vboxnet1` that is the one se before.


Now me must be able to ping each other machine but not outside of them network:
