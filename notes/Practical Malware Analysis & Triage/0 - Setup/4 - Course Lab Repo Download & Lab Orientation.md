We will use this github repository to do our activities:
- [https://github.com/HuskyHacks/PMAT-labs](https://github.com/HuskyHacks/PMAT-labs)

Download it on the FlareVM machine (we cna just change to NAT the vm settings network and change the dns in `View network connctions` -> `Properties` -> `IPv4` to automatically assign ).

Just downlaod it on the vm and change another time the files!
