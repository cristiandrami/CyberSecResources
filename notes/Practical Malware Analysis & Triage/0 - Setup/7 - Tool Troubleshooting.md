If during our process a tool is not present or not correctly installed we just need to put our machine on internet changing the netwrok adapter to `NAT` and change the dns setting to autmatic.

Then we need to search the tool on google and download it.


We can also take a snapshot pf the new version of FlareVM with the tool!
