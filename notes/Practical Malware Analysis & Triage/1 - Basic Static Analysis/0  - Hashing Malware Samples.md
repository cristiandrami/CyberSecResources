Here we will use the malware in `PMAT-labs/labs/1-1.BasicStaticAnalysis/Malware.Unknown.exe.malz/Malware.Unknown.exe.7z`

In the basic static analysis we don√¨t run the binary, we just analyze the source code and the binary of the malware.

The first thing we want to do is to extract the hashes of the malware.

# sha256sum hash
So we calculate the `sha256sum` first.

We open a terminal `cmder` on flarevm and we run:
```shell
sha256sum.exe Malware.Unknown.exe.malz
```

Then we run:
```shell
md5sum.exe Malware.Unknown.exe.malz
```
- ![[Pasted image 20250204164127.png]]


And we put both on a `.txt` file.
- 

We need it to fingerprint the malware.


Now we will check if this malware already is in a database as `VirusTotal`.
