In this case we will use:
- `PMAT-labs/labs/1-1.BasicStaticAnalysis/Malware.Unknown.exe.malz/Malware.Unknown.exe.7z`


Strings analysis is very important because we could get information about `urls` used by the malware and also other stuff.

If the malware is a simple malware we can just do a static analysis and extract the strings without running it.


# Floss
`Floss` can be used to extract strings from binary files:
```shell
floss.exe malware.exe.malz
```

Some strings are useless, but in this case we can find:
```text
C:\Users\Matt\source\repos\HuskyHacks\PMAT-maldev\src\DownloadFromURL\Release\DownloadFromURL.pdb
```
- ![[Pasted image 20250205115259.png]]



But also:
```text
URLDownloadToFileW       urlmon.dll              
InternetOpenUrlW   
InternetOpenW         
WININET.dll
```

They could be name of functions, libraries used and so on...


>NOTE: sometimes strings can be put into the binary to make the malware tricky and so to confuse the analyzer


## minimum length

In general we can increase the minimum length of the strings we want to find, since by default is 4 (some strings could be useless if they are less than 6 chars for example):
```shell
floss.exe -n 6 malware.exe.malz
```
- in this case we will search strings of 6 chars or more
