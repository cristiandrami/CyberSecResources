In this section we will use:
- `PMAT-labs/labs/1-1.BasicStaticAnalysis/Malware.Unknown.exe.malz/Malware.Unknown.exe.7z`

PEStudio is a tool that does automatically all the analysis we have done in the previous sections:
1. analysis without running the file
2. identifies the dpendencies and the libraries used (`.dll` and API calls)
3. gives us suspect indicators
4. analyzes the `PE sections` (checks if it is packed)
5. uses a db to check the sigantures of the binaries (to see if it is a known malware)
6. checks if the binary is signed and who signed it


We open `Malware.Unknown.exe.malz` and we can see:

If we go on the `indicators` section we can see a lot of information:

In the `libraries` section we can see all the malicious libraries imported:
- ![[Pasted image 20250205164841.png]]
- they are not malicius but they are generally used to create malwares


The section `strings` is also important and gives us all the readable strings in the binary file:

Then there is the `import` section that shows us the `API calls`:
