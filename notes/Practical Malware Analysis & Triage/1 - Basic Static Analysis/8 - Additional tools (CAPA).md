**capa** is a static analysis tool that automatically identifies the **capabilities and behaviors of malware** by analyzing executable files for Windows (PE), Linux (ELF), and macOS (Mach-O).

Unlike an antivirus, **capa** doesn’t look for known malware signatures but instead detects **functionalities and behaviors**, such as:
- Communication with a **Command & Control (C2) server**
- **Reading/writing the Windows Registry**
- Using **encryption functions**
- **Injecting code** into other processes
- **Establishing persistence** on a system

#### **How to use capa?**

1. **Download and install capa**
    - Available on GitHub: [https://github.com/mandiant/capa](https://github.com/mandiant/capa)
    - Supports Windows, Linux, and macOS.
2. **Run capa on a suspicious file**
    - Open a terminal or command prompt and type: `capa malware.exe`
3. **Use capa explorer (for IDA Pro)**
    - If you have **IDA Pro**, you can install the **capa explorer** plugin, which helps you visualize malware capabilities directly within the disassembly.
