We need to use `MobSF` to do our analysis here.

We just need to run on `REMnux`:
```bash
sudo apt update 

sudo apt install docker.io -y
```

After it we need to run:
```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 8000:8000 opensecurity/mobile-security-framework-mobsf:latest
```

> NOTE: the first time we need that it is connected to the internet (so change the network to `NAT`)

Each time we need to run it we have to use, also without internet:
```bash
docker run -it --rm -p 8000:8000 opensecurity/mobile-security-framework-mobsf:latest
```
