In this section we will use all the samples in:
- `PMAT-labs/labs/5-1.Automation-BlueJupyter/FORTRIAGE.7z`

# Setup
- Clone the PMAT-lab branch of the code repository and change directories into it on `REMnux`:
```bash
git clone --branch PMAT-lab https://github.com/HuskyHacks/blue-jupyter.git

cd blue-jupyter
```


- Run the following Docker build command:

```bash
sudo docker build -t bluejupyter .
```

- When the image is finished building, run the following command to launch the notebook with a published port of 8888 and a mounted volume to the dropbox directory:
```bash
sudo docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -v /home/remnux/blue-jupyter:/src bluejupyter
```

- Now, if you want to add malware to the dropbox, copy it from the PMAT-labs repository into the /home/remnux/blue-jupyter/malware-analysis/dropbox/ directory and it will also copy into the container.


# Why we use autmation?
It can allow us to study 34 sample per minute.



## Installation
### Linux
You need Jupyter Notebooks! On linux, run:

```
$ pip3 install jupyter
```

Clone and enter the directory:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/mttaggart/blue-jupyter.git && cd blue-jupyter
```

If you don't have it already, install `poetry`:

```
$ pip3 install poetry
```

Install the dependencies with `poetry`:

```
$ poetry install
```

Then, start a poetry shell and go to the directory of the notebook you want to run. Then, start the Jupyter server:

```
$ poetry shell
```

```
$ cd [notebook-directory]
```

```
$ jupyter notebook
```

For developing notebooks, install and use the Jupyter `lab` command:

```
$ pip3 install jupyterlab
```

```
$ jupyter lab
```


# Use it
Copy the samples into `blue-jupyter/dropbox`.

The result of the execution is:
