In this section we will use:
- `PMAT-labs/labs/5-2.RuleWriting/Malware.yara1.exe.malz.7z`

# Malware checking with yara64
To use yara in order to identify if a binary is a malware or not we can run on FlareVM:
```powershell
yara64 yara_rule.yara Malware.yara1.exe.malz -w -p 32
```
- `-w` is to suppress the warnings
- `-p 32` is for threads

The result is:
- ![[Pasted image 20250213170308.png]]
- so the binary matched the rule `PE_YOURETHEMANNOWDOG_NIM`
