In this section we will use:
- `PMAT-labs/labs/1-1.BasicStaticAnalysis/Malware.Unknown.exe.malz/Malware.Unknown.exe.7z`
- the same as static analysis


# What this malware does?
It basically tries to reach a malicious domain, if it cannot reach the domain then it exits and deletes itself.
- in our case we are in a sandbox and if we run it it will delete itself.

*Running it:*

- it deletes it self


# Running inetsim on REMux
So we run inetsim on REMnux:
```bash
inetsim
```
- ![[Pasted image 20250206113226.png]]


At the same time we run on REMnux `Wireshark`:
```bash
sudo wireshark
```

# Network indicators
If we take a look at the floss output on the malware we can see some possible network indicators:
- ![[Pasted image 20250206114414.png]]
So we copy `favicon.ico` and we put it into wireshark:
```
http.request.full_uri contains favicon.ico
```

Now we run the malware and we can see:
- ![[Pasted image 20250206114659.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20250206114748.png]]

So we got a network request as we imagined.
- The malware seems to request something on the network
