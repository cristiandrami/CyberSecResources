In an advanced static analysis what we do is:
- study the `Assembly Instructions of the malware` known as `ASM`
	- to do that we will use `disassemblers` and `decompilers`

So basically here we will do a reverse engeneer on the malware.


# Assembly
Assembly is a low-level programming language that machines use to understand and execute instructions.

At its core, every instruction is represented as a series of `0`s and `1`s (binary code). Assembly provides a more readable way to write these instructions while still being very close to the machine's raw operations.

*For example we have*:
- `mov`, `jmp`, `xor`

We gradually convert these instructions into more readable formats until we reach high-level programming languages like C or Python.
- Compilers then generate an executable file that contains machine code, which is based on assembly language.


A malware author writes it into an high level language such as:
```C++
void doEvilStuff(){...}

int main(){
	doEvilStuff();
}
```

A this point with a compiler they create an executable file. The compiler takes the code and converts it into pieces of bits strings (`0` and `1`) that the computer understands.

Assembly is one level of abstraction higher than machine language.


So when we use a disassembler we convert the machine language of a `.exe` (`0` and `1`) into assembly instructions.
