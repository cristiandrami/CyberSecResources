Here we will use:
- `PMAT-labs/labs/2-1.AdvancedStaticAnalysis/Dropper.DownloadFromURL.exe.malz/Dropper.DownloadFromURL.exe.7z`


On `Cutter` we open the `main` function:
- ![[Pasted image 20250207170643.png]]

In the beginning we can see that we push on the stack the `ebp` in order to push the address of our program in the stack:
- ![[Pasted image 20250207170734.png]]

When we see:
```assembly
push ebp
mov ebp, esp
```
- it is the setup for the calling of a function

Then we can see a lot of `push 0` and then a 
```assembly
push str.Mozilla_5.0
```
- very interesting stuff

After this we have an API call `InternetOpenW`:
- ![[Pasted image 20250207171041.png]]

So the `0s` and `Mozilla` are the parameter required by `InternetOpenW`:
- ![[Pasted image 20250207171226.png]]

As same as it we can see the `URLDownloadToFileW` API call:
- ![[Pasted image 20250207171355.png]]
