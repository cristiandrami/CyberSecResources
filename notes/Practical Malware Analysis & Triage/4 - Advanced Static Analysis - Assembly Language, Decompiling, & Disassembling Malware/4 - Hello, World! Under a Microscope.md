In this section we will study:
- `PMAT-labs\labs\2-1.AdvancedStaticAnalysis\helloWorld-c`

The source code of this executable files is:
- ![[Pasted image 20250210103002.png]]

So now we open cutter on `helloWorld.exe`:
- ![[Pasted image 20250210103236.png]]
- As we can see we have a lot of information on the debug function used
But malwares in general use to strip the name of the functions in order to obfuscate them.


Now if we give a look at the strings of the program and we search for `hello` we can see we have `Hello world`:
- ![[Pasted image 20250210103652.png]]

We click on it and it shows us where it is used:
- ![[Pasted image 20250210103921.png]]



If we visit the decompiler we can notice that it contains a pseudo code of the executable:
- ![[Pasted image 20250210104811.png]]
- in this case is prety similar to the original one
