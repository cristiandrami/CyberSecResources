IN this case we will use:
- `PMAT-labs/labs/2-2.AdvancedDynamicAnalysis/helloWorld-c

Here we open cutter and we take the `main` funtion `memory address`:
- ![[Pasted image 20250210144219.png]]

And we put it into the debugger:
- `0x00401530`
- ![[Pasted image 20250210144358.png]]
- using `CTRL + G`

Here we put a breakpoint on this part and one on the `printf` call:
- ![[Pasted image 20250210144458.png]]

Here we can notice that with the move we are using the string `Hello wrold` and we are charging it in the registers, but we could change it:
- ![[Pasted image 20250210150150.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20250210150245.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20250210150308.png]]

Now if we go one instruction far we can see:
- ![[Pasted image 20250210150337.png]]
