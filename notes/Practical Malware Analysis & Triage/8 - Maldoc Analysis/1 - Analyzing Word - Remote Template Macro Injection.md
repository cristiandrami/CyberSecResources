In thsi case we will study two `word` file:
- `PMAT-labs/labs/3-1.GonePhishing-MaldocAnalysis/Word/`

# DOCM file
It is similar to `.xlsm` file in excel. It is a Macro.
# oledump.py 
We use always `oledump.py` on it to extract info:
```powershell
oledump.py bookReport.docm
```
- ![[Pasted image 20250211113252.png]]

```powershell
oledump.py -s 3 --vbadecompresscorrupt bookReport.docm
```
- ![[Pasted image 20250211113415.png]]

# DOCX file
Generally we think that `.docx` file are safe from malware, but it is not like that.

Let's see the file `IncrediblyPolishedResume.docx`:
- ![[Pasted image 20250211113749.png]]


So what we can do here is to change the extension to `.zip` and unzip it:
- ![[Pasted image 20250211113915.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20250211114054.png]]

The folder `word/_rels` is generally used to put the settings when we are using templates.

In this case the document is a template. 

So we can study this settings using visuaa studio code:
- ![[Pasted image 20250211114243.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20250211114319.png]]

We can see it tries to download a `.docm` file from a strange domain.
