# Studying the file
This is a `.cs` file:
- ![[Pasted image 20250211153913.png]]

This type of file is in the `C#` programming language. It is used for `.NET` application and so on. 

Basically it is used for windows applications.



So we open it in `Visual studio code`:
- ![[Pasted image 20250211154242.png]]

It is very interesting...

1.  **Shellcode (`rsrc` array)**
    - The `rsrc` byte array contains a **payload in raw machine code**.
    - It could be a malicious shellcode
2. **Memory Allocation (`VirtualAlloc`)**
    - Allocates memory with `MEM_COMMIT`, which is **writable but not executable yet**.
    - Copies the shellcode into the allocated memory using `Marshal.Copy()`.
3. **Modifying Memory Permissions (`VirtualProtect`)**
    - Changes the memory protection to `PAGE_EXECUTE_READ`, allowing execution.
4. **Executing the Payload (`CreateThread`)**
    - Creates a new thread pointing to the shellcode's memory address.
    - Waits for execution to complete with `WaitForSingleObject()`

`WaitForSingleObject(hThread, 0xFFFFFFFF)` is very intersting. 
- This because when we use `0xFFFFFFFF` we are putting in wait the thread for a non definite amount of time. So the process will never be into the process list.



## converting shellcode in readable text

We can do it using python.

We copy the shellcode into a file `shellcode.txt` in REMnux:
```C

```


At this point we create a python script that converts it:
```python
with open("shell.txt", "r") as file:
        hex_string = file.read().replace(",", "").replace("0x", "")
        hex_encode = hex_string.encode()

#print(hex_string)
#print(hex_encode)
with open("mal.bin", "wb") as file:
        file.write(hex_encode)
```
- we open the text file and we remove `0x` before each byte
- we save the binary content into a file called `mal.bin`

Now we need to pass the file into the windows machine so we open a server on REMnux:
```bash
sudo python3 -m http.server 80
```

And then on the windows machine:
```powershell
wget 10.0.0.4:80/mal.bin
```


# using scdbg to get info about the shellcode
At this point we run the command:
```powershell
scdbg /f mal.bin -s -1
```
- `/f` is for choosing the file
- `-s -1` is used to set a unlimited number on the number of steps to do

The result is:
- ![[Pasted image 20250211160717.png]]
- this shellcode downloads a file and then executes it
