# exploit db
One of the most used tool to **==find vulnerabilites for services and so==** on is `exploit-db` :
- [https://www.exploit-db.com/](https://www.exploit-db.com/)

The idea is to search for the service and version we have and see if there are exploits:

In alternative we can directly search on google `service version exploit` and generally there are exploits on github, if it is vulnerable.


# searchsploit
Another way is to use `searchsploit` that is connected to `metasploit`.

Here we just need to use:
```bash
searchsploit Service Version
```
- we cannot be so precise because it searchs for exact matches
