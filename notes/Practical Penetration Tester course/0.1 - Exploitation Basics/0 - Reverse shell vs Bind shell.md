**==A reverse shell happens when the victim connects to the attacker.==**

Generally it is done using `netcat` but for the connection it can be used any other way.

- `-e /bin/sh` means that we want to execute `/bin/sh` into the connection

# Bind shell
**==This happens when the attacker connects to the victim on a port.==**

- it doesn't happen often
- but sometimes it can work instead of a reverse one
