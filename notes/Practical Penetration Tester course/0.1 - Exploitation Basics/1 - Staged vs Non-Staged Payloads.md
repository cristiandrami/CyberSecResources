# Non staged payload
A `non-staged payload` is a paylload in which **==the exploit shellcode is sent all at once==**.

It is larger in size and it won't always work.

*For example a non staged payload is*: `windows/meterpreter_reverse_tcp`

# Staged payload
A `staged payload` is a **==payload sent in stages==** and can be less stable.

*For example a non staged payload is*: `windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp`
