A **brute force attack** is a **==method used to guess a password, encryption key, or other protected information by trying all possible combinations until the correct one is found==**.

# Hydra
One tool used to do that is `hydra`, that can do a lot of activities.

*For example it can be used to brute force ssh:*
```bash
hydra -l username -P wordlist.txt ssh://IP:PORT -t numerb_of_attempts -V
```
- if we use `-L` we have to pass a list of usernames
- `-t` is used to limit the attempts
- `-V` is for verbose
