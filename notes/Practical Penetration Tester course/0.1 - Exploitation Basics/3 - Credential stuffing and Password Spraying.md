# Credential stuffing
**==The credential stuffing is an attack in which we try to login into a server or website using credentials that were breached.==**
- So we use breached accounts to login in other services (it can have results when people reuse the credentials)

# With BURP
With burp we can easily do it when we intercept the login request:
- ![[Pasted image 20250113104917.png]]
We just need to send it to the `Intruder` and use the `Pitchfork`.

As the first payload we put the usernames:
- ![[Pasted image 20250113111610.png]]

On the second the passwords:
- ![[Pasted image 20250113111623.png]]

In this case we use the `pitchfork` because it **==will use the first username and the first password, the second username with the second password and so on==**. It will use the correct username and passwords.

We can also filter the responses removing the ones we don't want. In this case when we are not able to login it shows us `We could not sign you !`, so we remove all responses on it:
- ![[Pasted image 20250113111916.png]]
- `Options` -> `Grep - Match`

At this point we oder from the presence of the `Match`:
- ![[Pasted image 20250113112013.png]]
- No results in this case


# Password spraying
The idea is to use a small number of passwords for different accounts. 

So we can use breached passsword of a user in order to access on `LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram...` and so on.
