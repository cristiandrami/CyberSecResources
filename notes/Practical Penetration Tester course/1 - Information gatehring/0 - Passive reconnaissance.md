# Web/Host assessment
## target validation
When we get a web or host assessment the first thing to do is the Target validation:
- This is important to be sure that you are attacking the right victim

So in this case we have to use tools as:
- WHOIS
- nslookup
- dnsrecon


## Finding subdomains
Then we have to find the subdomains, in this case we can use:
- Google Fu
- dif
- NMAP
- Sublist3r
- Bluto 
- crt.sh
- ecc

## Fingerprinting
At this point we need to do a finger print, so we need to know what is running on the website.

We can do it with:
- NMAP
- Wappalyzer
- WhatWeb
- BuiltWith
- Netcat


## Data breaches
In the end we need to understand if there are data breaches.

To do it we can use:
- HavelBeenPwned
