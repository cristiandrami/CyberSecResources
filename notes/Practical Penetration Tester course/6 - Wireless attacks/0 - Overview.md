It is the testing of wireless networks. IN this part we will focus on the tow networks:
- WPA2 PSK 
- WPA2 Enterprise.

We will:
- **evaluate strength of PSK** (capturing the handshake and cracking it)
- **review nearby networks**, 
- **assessing guest networks**, if it has has no password, or if it has password how strong is
- **checking network access**


We will use:
- a wireless card (that can go in monitor mode Alfa AWUD036NH is good one)
- a router 
- laptop

# Process of Wireless hacking

We have to follow some stages:

The handshake is what we need to perform the cracking of password (brute force or rainbow tables...).
