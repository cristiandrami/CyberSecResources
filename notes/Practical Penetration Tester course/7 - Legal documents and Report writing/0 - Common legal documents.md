One of the most important thing in Penetration testing is the legal documentation:
- ![[Pasted image 20250110111948.png]]
## Sales
**==In the sales process we have to sign the NDA, non mutual disclosure agreement.==**
- **==This document is used to force the two part do don't talk about the PT and the information retrieved during it in public.==**
- it is used to protect the company 

**==The Master Service Agreement (MSA) is used to specify the responsibilities of both the parts.==**
- search for it in rapid7 master service agreement [https://www.rapid7.com/legal/msa/](https://www.rapid7.com/legal/msa/)

**==Statement of work is used to define the business stuff, like the delivery date of the report, the cost of the PT and so on.==**


## Before testing

The Rules of Engagement (ROE) is used to define what you can do in the P.
- *for example I have an IP, i can do this attack but not DDoS and so on*

It defines all we can do and we cannot do.
## After testing 
We need to write the Findings Report that contains all the finding from high level and technical level.
