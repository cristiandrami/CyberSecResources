A **Windows domain** is a group of users and computers under the administration of a given business. 

The main idea behind a domain is to centralise the administration of common components of a Windows computer network in a single repository called **Active Directory (AD)**. 

The server that runs the Active Directory services is known as a **Domain Controller (DC)**.

The main advantages of having a configured Windows domain are:
- **Centralised identity management:** All users across the network can be configured from Active Directory with minimum effort.
- **Managing security policies:** You can configure security policies directly from Active Directory and apply them to users and computers across the network as needed.
